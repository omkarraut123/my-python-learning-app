<h1>Introduction to Graphs</a></h1>
<p>In this chapter we will study graphs. Graphs are a more general
structure than the trees we studied in the last chapter; in fact you can
think of a tree as a special kind of graph. Graphs can be used to
represent many interesting things about our world, including systems of
roads, airline flights from city to city, how the Internet is connected,
or even the sequence of classes you must take to complete a major in
computer science. We will see in this chapter that once we have a good
representation for a problem, we can use some standard graph algorithms
to solve what otherwise might seem to be a very difficult problem.</p>
<p>While it is relatively easy for humans to look at a road map and
understand the relationships between different places, a computer has no
such knowledge. However, we can also think of a road map as a graph.
When we do so we can have our computer do interesting things for us. If
you have ever used one of the Internet map sites, you know that a
computer can find the shortest, quickest, or easiest path from one place
to another.</p>
<p>As a student of computer science you may wonder about the courses you
must take in order to get a major. A graph is good way to represent the
prerequisites and other interdependencies among courses.
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig1"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 1</span></a> shows another graph. This one represents the courses
and the order in which they must be taken to complete a major in
computer science at Luther College.</p>
