<h1>Trees Terminology</a></h1>
<dl class="docutils">
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Node</dt>
<dd>A node is a fundamental part of a tree. It can have a name, which we
call the “key.” A node may also have additional information. We call
this additional information the “payload.” While the payload
information is not central to many tree algorithms, it is often
critical in applications that make use of trees.</dd>
<dt>Edge</dt>
<dd>An edge is another fundamental part of a tree. An edge connects two
nodes to show that there is a relationship between them. Every node
(except the root) is connected by exactly one incoming edge from
another node. Each node may have several outgoing edges.</dd>
<dt>Root</dt>
<dd>The root of the tree is the only node in the tree that has no
incoming edges. In Figure&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="ExamplesofTrees.html#fig-filetree"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 2</span></a>, / is the root of the tree.</dd>
<dt>Path</dt>
<dd>A path is an ordered list of nodes that are connected by edges. For
example,
Mammal <span class="math">\(\rightarrow\)</span> Carnivora <span class="math">\(\rightarrow\)</span> Felidae <span class="math">\(\rightarrow\)</span> Felis <span class="math">\(\rightarrow\)</span> Domestica
is a path.</dd>
<dt>Children</dt>
<dd>The set of nodes <span class="math">\(c\)</span> that have incoming edges from the same
node to are said to be the children of that node. In Figure
<a class="reference internal" href="ExamplesofTrees.html#fig-filetree"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 2</span></a>, nodes log/, spool/, and yp/ are the children of node
var/.</dd>
<dt>Parent</dt>
<dd>A node is the parent of all the nodes it connects to with outgoing
edges. In <a class="reference internal" href="ExamplesofTrees.html#fig-filetree"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 2</span></a> the node var/ is the parent of nodes
log/, spool/, and yp/.</dd>
<dt>Sibling</dt>
<dd>Nodes in the tree that are children of the same parent are said to
be siblings. The nodes etc/ and usr/ are siblings in the filesystem
tree.</dd>
<dt>Subtree</dt>
<dd>A subtree is a set of nodes and edges comprised of a parent and all
the descendants of that parent.</dd>
<dt>Leaf Node</dt>
<dd>A leaf node is a node that has no children. For example, Human and
Chimpanzee are leaf nodes in <a class="reference internal" href="ExamplesofTrees.html#fig-biotree"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 1</span></a>.</dd>
<dt>Level</dt>
<dd>The level of a node <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is the number of edges on the path
from the root node to <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. For example, the level of the
Felis node in <a class="reference internal" href="ExamplesofTrees.html#fig-biotree"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 1</span></a> is five. By definition, the level
of the root node is zero.</dd>
<dt>Height</dt>
<dd>The height of a tree is equal to the maximum level of any node in
the tree. The height of the tree in <a class="reference internal" href="ExamplesofTrees.html#fig-filetree"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 2</span></a> is two.</dd>
</dl>
<p>With the basic vocabulary now defined, we can move on to a formal
definition of a tree. In fact, we will provide two definitions of a
tree. One definition involves nodes and edges. The second definition,
which will prove to be very useful, is a recursive definition.</p>
A tree consists of a set of nodes and a set of
edges that connect pairs of nodes. A tree has the following properties:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li>One node of the tree is designated as the root node.</li>
<li>Every node <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, except the root node, is connected by an edge
from exactly one other node <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(p\)</span> is the
parent of <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.</li>
<li>A unique path traverses from the root to each node.</li>
<li>If each node in the tree has a maximum of two children, we say that
the tree is a <strong>binary tree</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-nodeedgetree"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 3</span></a> illustrates a tree that fits definition one.
The arrowheads on the edges indicate the direction of the connection.</p>
