<h1>Introduction to Trees</a></h1>

<p>Now that we have studied linear data structures like
stacks and queues and have some experience with recursion, we will look
at a common data structure called the <strong>tree</strong>. Trees are used in many
areas of computer science, including operating systems, graphics,
database systems, and computer networking. Tree data structures have
many things in common with their botanical cousins. A tree data
structure has a root, branches, and leaves. The difference between a
tree in nature and a tree in computer science is that a tree data
structure has its root at the top and its leaves on the bottom.</p>
<p>Before we begin our study of tree data structures, let’s look at a few
common examples. Our first example of a tree is a classification tree
from biology. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-biotree"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 1</span></a> shows an example of the biological
classification of some animals. From this simple example, we can learn
about several properties of trees. The first property this example
demonstrates is that trees are hierarchical. By hierarchical, we mean
that trees are structured in layers with the more general things near
the top and the more specific things near the bottom. The top of the
hierarchy is the Kingdom, the next layer of the tree (the “children” of
the layer above) is the Phylum, then the Class, and so on. However, no
matter how deep we go in the classification tree, all the organisms are
still animals.</p>

<span id="fig-biotree"></span><img alt="image" src="images/biology.png" style="width: 390.0px; height: 383.0px;" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Figure 1: Taxonomy of Some Common Animals Shown as a Tree</span></p>
</div>

<p>Notice that you can start at the top of the tree and follow a path made
of circles and arrows all the way to the bottom. At each level of the
tree we might ask ourselves a question and then follow the path that
agrees with our answer. For example we might ask, “Is this animal a
Chordate or an Arthropod?” If the answer is “Chordate” then we follow
that path and ask, “Is this Chordate a Mammal?” If not, we are stuck
(but only in this simplified example). When we are at the Mammal level
we ask, “Is this Mammal a Primate or a Carnivore?” We can keep following
paths until we get to the very bottom of the tree where we have the
common name.</p>
<p>A second property of trees is that all of the children of one node are
independent of the children of another node. For example, the Genus
Felis has the children Domestica and Leo. The Genus Musca also has a
child named Domestica, but it is a different node and is independent of
the Domestica child of Felis. This means that we can change the node
that is the child of Musca without affecting the child of Felis.</p>
<p>A third property is that each leaf node is unique. We can specify a path
from the root of the tree to a leaf that uniquely identifies each
species in the animal kingdom; for example, Animalia-->Chordate-->Mammal-->Carnivora-->Felidae-->Felis-->Domestica.</p>
<p>Another example of a tree structure that you probably use every day is a
file system. In a file system, directories, or folders, are structured
as a tree. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-filetree"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 2</span></a> illustrates a small part of a Unix file
system hierarchy.</p>

<div class="figure align-center" id="id2">
<span id="fig-filetree"></span><img alt="image" src="images/directory.png" style="width: 687.0px; height: 126.0px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Figure 2: A Small Part of the Unix File System Hierarchy</span></p>
</div>

<p>The file system tree has much in common with the biological
classification tree. You can follow a path from the root to any
directory. That path will uniquely identify that subdirectory (and all
the files in it). Another important property of trees, derived from
their hierarchical nature, is that you can move entire sections of a
tree (called a <strong>subtree</strong>) to a different position in the tree without
affecting the lower levels of the hierarchy. For example, we could take
the entire subtree staring with /etc/, detach etc/ from the root and
reattach it under usr/. This would change the unique pathname to httpd
from /etc/httpd to /usr/etc/httpd, but would not affect the contents or
any children of the httpd directory.</p>
