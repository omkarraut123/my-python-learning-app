<h1>Graphs Terminology</a></h1>
<p>Now that we have looked at some examples of graphs, we will more
formally define a graph and its components. We already know some of
these terms from our discussion of trees.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Vertex</dt>
<dd>A vertex (also called a “node”) is a fundamental part of a graph. It
can have a name, which we will call the “key.” A vertex may also
have additional information. We will call this additional
information the “payload.”</dd>
<dt>Edge</dt>
<dd>An edge (also called an “arc”) is another fundamental part of a
graph. An edge connects two vertices to show that there is a
relationship between them. Edges may be one-way or two-way. If the
edges in a graph are all one-way, we say that the graph is a
<strong>directed graph</strong>, or a <strong>digraph</strong>. The class prerequisites graph
shown above is clearly a digraph since you must take some classes
before others.</dd>
<dt>Weight</dt>
<dd>Edges may be weighted to show that there is a cost to go from one
vertex to another. For example in a graph of roads that connect one
city to another, the weight on the edge might represent the distance
between the two cities.</dd>
</dl>
<p>With those definitions in hand we can formally define a graph. A graph
can be represented by <span class="math">(G)</span> where <span class="math">(G =(V,E))</span>. For the
graph <span class="math">(G)</span>, <span class="math">(V)</span> is a set of vertices and <span class="math">(E)</span> is a
set of edges. Each edge is a tuple <span class="math">((v,w))</span> where
<span class="math">(w,v in V)</span>. We can add a third component to the edge tuple to
represent a weight. A subgraph <span class="math">(s)</span> is a set of edges <span class="math">(e)</span>
and vertices <span class="math">(v)</span> such that <span class="math">(e subset E)</span> and
<span class="math">(v subset V)</span>.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-dgsimple"><span class="std std-ref">Figure&nbsp; 2</span></a> shows another example of a simple weighted
digraph. Formally we can represent this graph as the set of six
vertices:</p>
<div class="math">
[V = { V0,V1,V2,V3,V4,V5 }]</div>
<p>and the set of nine edges:</p>
<div class="math">
E ={ (v0,v1,5), (v1,v2,4), (v2,v3,9), (v3,v4,7), (v4,v0,1),
             (v0,v5,2),(v5,v4,8),(v3,v5,3),(v5,v2,1)
             }</div>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id1">
<span id="fig-dgsimple"></span><img alt="../_images/digraph.png" src="images/digraph.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Figure 2: A Simple Example of a Directed Graph</span></p>
</div>
<p>The example graph in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-dgsimple"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 2</span></a> helps illustrate two other
key graph terms:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Path</dt>
<dd>A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices that are connected by
edges. Formally we would define a path as
<span class="math">(w_1, w_2, ..., w_n)</span> such that
<span class="math">((w_i, w_{i+1}) in E)</span> for all <span class="math">1<=i<=n-1</span>.
The unweighted path length is the number of edges in the path,
specifically <span class="math">(n-1)</span>. The weighted path length is the sum of
the weights of all the edges in the path. For example in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-dgsimple"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 2</span></a> the path from <span class="math">(V3)</span> to <span class="math">(V1)</span> is
the sequence of vertices <span class="math">((V3,V4,V0,V1))</span>. The edges are
<span class="math">{(v3,v4,7),(v4,v0,1),(v0,v1,5) }</span>.</dd>
<dt>Cycle</dt>
<dd>A cycle in a directed graph is a path that starts and ends at the
same vertex. For example, in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-dgsimple"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 2</span></a> the path
<span class="math">((V5,V2,V3,V5))</span> is a cycle. A graph with no cycles is called
an <strong>acyclic graph</strong>. A directed graph with no cycles is called a
<strong>directed acyclic graph</strong> or a <strong>DAG</strong>. 
as a DAG.</dd>
