<p>So, you've never programmed before. As we go through this tutorial, I
 will attempt to teach you how to program. There really is only one way 
to learn to program. <b>You</b> must read <i>code</i> and write <i>code</i>
 (as computer programs are often called). I'm going to show you lots of 
code. You should type in code that I show you to see what happens. Play 
around with it and make changes. The worst that can happen is that it 
won't work. When I type in code it will be formatted like this:</p>

<div dir="ltr" class="mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr">
<div class="python source-python">
<pre class="de1"><span class="co1">##Python is easy to learn</span><br><span class="kw1">print</span> <span class="st0">"Hello, World!"</span>
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>That's so it is easy to distinguish from the other text. If you're 
reading this on the web, you'll notice the code is in color -- that's 
just to make it stand out, and to make the different parts of the code 
stand out from each other. The code you enter will probably not be 
colored, or the colors may be different, but it won't affect the code as
 long as you enter it the same way as it's printed here.</p>

<p>If the computer prints something out it will be formatted like this:</p>

<pre>Hello, World!<br></pre>

<p>(Note that printed text goes to your screen, and does not involve 
paper. Before computers had screens, the output of computer programs 
would be printed on paper.)</p>

<p>If you try this program out and you get a syntax error, check and see
 what version of python you have. If you have python 3.0, you should be 
using the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer%27s_Tutorial_for_Python_3.0" title="Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 3.0" class="mw-redirect">Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 3.0</a>. This article was made for Python 2.6</p>

<p>There will often be a mixture of the text you type (which is shown in <b>bold</b>) and the text the program prints to the screen, which would look like this:</p>

<pre>Halt!<br>Who Goes there? <b>Josh</b><br>You may pass, Josh<br></pre>

<p>(Some of the tutorial has not been converted to this format. Since this is a wiki, you can convert it when you find it.)</p>

<p>I will also introduce you to the terminology of programming - for example, that programming is often referred to as <i>coding</i>. This will not only help you understand what programmers are talking about, but also help the learning process.</p>

<p>Now, on to more important things. In order to program in Python you 
need the Python software. If you don't already have the Python software 
go to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.python.org/download/">http://www.python.org/download/</a> and get the proper version for your platform. Download it, read the instructions and get it installed.</p>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Installing_Python">Installing Python</span></h3>

<p>For Python programming you need a working Python installation and a text editor. Python comes with its own editor <i>IDLE</i>,
 which is quite nice and totally sufficient for the beginning. As you 
get more into programming, you will probably switch to some other editor
 like <i>emacs</i>, <i>vi</i> or another.</p>

<p>The Python download page is <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.python.org/download">http://www.python.org/download</a>. The most recent version is 3.1, but any <i>Python 2.x</i> version since 2.2 will work for this tutorial. Be careful with the upcoming <i>Python 3</i>, though, as some major details will change and break this tutorial's examples. A version of this tutorial for Python 3 is at <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer%27s_Tutorial_for_Python_3" title="Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 3">Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 3</a>.
 There are various different installation files for different computer 
platforms available on the download site. Here are some specific 
instructions for the most common operating systems:</p>

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Linux.2C_BSD_and_Unix_users">Linux, BSD and Unix users</span></h4>

<p>You are probably lucky and Python is already installed on your machine. To test it type <tt>python</tt> on a command line. If you see something like that in the following section, you are set.</p>

<p>If you have to install Python, just use the operating system's 
package manager or go to the repository where your packages are 
available and get Python. Alternatively, you can compile Python from 
scratch after downloading the source code. If you get the source code 
make sure you compile in the Tk extension if you want to use IDLE.</p>

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Mac_users">Mac users</span></h4>

<p>Starting from Mac OS X (Tiger), Python ships by default with the 
operating system, but you might want to update to the newer version 
(check the version by starting <tt>python</tt> in a command line 
terminal). Also IDLE (the Python editor) might be missing in the 
standard installation. If you want to (re-)install Python, have a look 
at the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.python.org/download/mac/">Mac page on the Python download site</a>.</p>

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Windows_users">Windows users</span></h4>

<p>Some computer manufacturers pre-install Python. To check if you 
already have it installed, open command prompt (cmd in run menu) or 
MS-DOS and type python. If it says "Bad command or file name" you will 
need to download the appropriate Windows installer (the normal one, if 
you do not have a 64-bit AMD or Intel chip). Start the installer by 
double-clicking it and follow the procedure. Python for windows can be 
downloaded from the official <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.python.org/getit/">site of python</a></p>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Interactive_Mode">Interactive Mode</span></h3>

<p>Go into IDLE (also called the Python GUI). You should see a window that has some text like this:</p>

<pre>Python 2.5.1 (r251:54863, Apr 18 2007, 08:51:08) [MSC v.1310 32 bit (Intel)] on win32<br>Type "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.<br><br><br>   ****************************************************************<br>   Personal firewall software may warn about the connection IDLE<br>   makes to its subprocess using this computer's internal loopback<br>   interface.  This connection is not visible on any external<br>   interface and no data is sent to or received from the Internet.<br>   ****************************************************************<br><br><br>IDLE 1.2.1      <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br></pre>

<p>The <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> is Python's way of telling you that you
 are in interactive mode. In interactive mode what you type is 
immediately run. Try typing <code>1+1</code> in. Python will respond with <code>2</code>.
 Interactive mode allows you to test out and see what Python will do. If
 you ever feel you need to play with new Python statements, go into 
interactive mode and try them out.</p>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Creating_and_Running_Programs">Creating and Running Programs</span></h3>

<p>Go into IDLE if you are not already. In the menu at the top, select <code>File</code> then <code>New Window</code>. In the new window that appears, type the following:</p>

<div dir="ltr" class="mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr">
<div class="python source-python">
<pre class="de1"><span class="kw1">print</span> <span class="st0">"Hello, World!"</span>
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Now save the program: select <code>File</code> from the menu, then <code>Save</code>. Save it as "<code>hello.py</code>" (you can save it in any folder you want). Now that it is saved it can be run.</p>

<p>Next run the program by going to <code>Run</code> then <code>Run Module</code> (or if you have a older version of IDLE use <code>Edit</code> then <code>Run script</code>). This will output <code>Hello, World!</code> on the <code>*Python Shell*</code> window.</p>

<p>For a more in-depth introduction to IDLE, a longer tutorial with screenshots can be found at <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/%7Edyoo/python/idle_intro/index.html">http://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dyoo/python/idle_intro/index.html</a></p>

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Running_Python_Programs_in_Unix">Running Python Programs in Unix</span></h4>

<p>If you are using Unix (such as Linux, Mac OSX, or BSD), if you make the program executable with <code>chmod</code>, and have as the first line:</p>

<div dir="ltr" class="mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr">
<div class="python source-python">
<pre class="de1"><span class="co1">#!/usr/bin/env python2</span>
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>you can run the python program with <code>./hello.py</code> like any other command.</p>

<p>Note: In some computer environments, you need to write:</p>

<div dir="ltr" class="mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr">
<div class="python source-python">
<pre class="de1"><span class="co1">#!/usr/bin/env python</span>
</pre></div>
</div>

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Program_file_names">Program file names</span></h4>

<p>It is very useful to stick to some rules regarding the file names of Python programs. Otherwise some things <i>might</i>
 go wrong unexpectedly. These don't matter as much for programs, but you
 can have weird problems if you don't follow them for module names 
(modules will be discussed later).</p>

<ol>
<li>Always save the program with the extension <tt>.py</tt>. Do not put another dot somewhere else in the file name.</li><li>Only use standard characters for file names: letters, numbers, dash (<tt>-</tt>) and underscore (<tt>_</tt>).</li><li>White space (" ") should not be used at all (use e.g. underscores instead).</li><li>Do not use anything other than a letter (particularly no numbers!) at the beginning of a file name.</li><li>Do not use "non-english" characters (such as <tt>ä</tt>, <tt>ö</tt>, <tt>ü</tt>, <tt>å</tt> or <tt>ß</tt>) in your file names—or, even better, do not use them at all when programming.</li>
</ol>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Using_Python_from_the_command_line">Using Python from the command line</span></h3>

<p>If you don't want to use Python from the command line, you don't have to, just use IDLE. To get into interactive mode just type <code>python</code> without any arguments. To run a program, create it with a text editor (Emacs has a good Python mode) and then run it with <code>python program_name</code>.</p>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Where_to_get_help">Where to get help</span></h3>

<p>At some point in your Python career you will probably get stuck and 
have no clue about how to solve the problem you are supposed to work on.
 This tutorial only covers the basics of Python programming, but there 
is a lot of further information available.</p>

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Python_documentation">Python documentation</span></h4>

<p>First of all, Python is very well documented. There might even be 
copies of these documents on your computer, which came with your Python 
installation: <b>* The official <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://docs.python.org/tut/tut.html">Python Tutorial</a> by Guido van Rossum is often a good starting point for general questions</b>.</p>

<ul>
<li>For questions about standard modules (you will learn what this is later), the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://docs.python.org/lib/lib.html">Python Library Reference</a> is the place to look.</li><li>If you really want to get to know something about the details of the language, the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://docs.python.org/ref/ref.html">Python Reference Manual</a> is comprehensive but quite complex for beginners.</li>
</ul>

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Python_user_community">Python user community</span></h4>

<p>There are a lot of other Python users out there, and usually they are
 nice and willing to help you. This very active user community is 
organised mostly through mailing lists and a newsgroup:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor">tutor mailing list</a> is for folks who want to ask questions regarding how to learn computer programming with the Python language.</li><li>The <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.python.org/community/lists/#python-help">python-help mailing list</a> is python.org's help desk. You can ask a group of knowledgeable volunteers questions about all your Python problems.</li><li>The Python newsgroup <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="news:comp.lang.python">comp.lang.python</a> (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/">Google groups archive</a>) is the place for general Python discussions, questions and the central meeting point of the community.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order not to reinvent the wheel and discuss the same questions again and again, people will appreciate very much if you <i>do a web search for a solution to your problem before contacting these lists!</i></p>
